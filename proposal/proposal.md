# Research Proposal: Analysis of Boston Airbnb Listings
### Big Picture Question: What attributes about a Boston Airbnb listing are most influential to its list price?

By Tommy McDade, Brooks Walsh, and Taylor Sheridan

## Research Question

After finding correlations and testing different influences, can we predict future Airbnb list prices?
   - This project will be about relationships as well as prediction. 
       - We will do a thorough EDA on our data set (including visuals) to represent the many relationships between different listing attributes and price.
       - After the important relationships are determined, we will use regression models and machine learning to create an accurate predictor of list prices
       - The metrics for success in this project include:
           - A dashboard to visually represent different metrics based on geographic location
           - A maximized R-Squared value (*or a different maximized/minimized measurement statistic, based on our choice of model*)

## Necessary Data

1. The Data will be primarily collected from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston):
- sample period: 9/5/2016 - 9/4/2017
    - There are 3 data sets included from Kaggle:
    1. calendar.csv
        - observation: Airbnb listings
        - rows: 1.31 million
        - columns: 4
        - index: "listing_id" and "date"
        - variables: "available (Bool)", "price(continuous)"
            - price is missing 51% of values
    2. listings.csv
        - observation: Airbnb listings
        - rows: 3585
        - columns: 95
        - index: "id", "scrape_id"
        - variables: too many to reasonably include in a proposal
            - a few examples:
                - "host_since", "maximum_nights", "require_guest_profile_picture"
    3. reviews.csv
        - observation: reviews based on Airbnb listings
        - rows: 68.3k
        - columns: 6
        - index: "listing_id", "id", "reviewer_id"
        - variables: "date", "reviewer_name", "comments"

2. To display maps and geographic data, we will need [2020 census tract data](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/census-2020-tracts/resource/1721fbb7-ee56-4a61-9e1b-2f2342d202d1).
    - We will likely be using the shapefile version    

3. The **raw inputs** for this project will be 3 of the 4 data sets described above in .csv format and a shapefile for use in geographic data.
    - All of these data sets will be saved to a folder called "inputs"
    - Any important dataframes/visuals that are created will be saved to a folder called "outputs"

4. High-level data cleaning plan:
- The 3 datasets that are obtained from Kaggle (calendar.csv, listings.csv, reviews.csv) are already fairly clean
    - There are several variables that may need to be a different data type in order to perform analysis
    - Some variables are full of text, and will likely need parsing to be used effectively
    - Some variables are URLs, which likely aren't needed
    - Because there are so many variables, and some are quite specific:
        - There are **a LOT** of NAN values that should be replaced with 0 (or a value that is consistent with the context)
- The last data set (used to create the map) is from 2020 census, and is not in a usable format originally
    - luckily there is a package for python that reads shapefiles effectively:
        - ```import geopandas as gpd```
