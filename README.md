[Streamlit Dashboard Repo](https://github.com/Brooks377/SSLS_dashboard)


## About this Repo:
In the "build" folder there are a number of notebook files:
- "OverviewMarkdown.ipynb", "EDA_Methodology.ipynb", and "ML_discussion.ipynb" are all used for creating the overview page
- The rest of the .ipynb files are assorted code and EDA to help build the website.
  - **Important Note**: The files in this repo are for creating the contents of the "outputs" folder for use in the streamlit app. These notebooks contain some additional, unnecessary code; we felt it was helpful to leave it here to see how it has changed as we cleaned/moved it into the SSLS_dashboard repo.
  - Despite the previous note, all files besides "Prediction.ipynb" will produce desired outputs when run from top to bottom.
